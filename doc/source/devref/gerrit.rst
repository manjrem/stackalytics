Code Reviews with Gerrit
========================

Stackalytics uses the `Gerrit`_ tool to review proposed code changes.
The review site is https://review.opendev.org.

Gerrit is a complete replacement for GitHub pull requests. `All GitHub pull
requests to the Stackalytics repository will be ignored`.

See `Gerrit Workflow Quick Reference`_ for information about how to get
started using Gerrit. See `Development Workflow`_ for more detailed
documentation on how to work with Gerrit.
